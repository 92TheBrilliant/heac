# Issue Resolution Summary

## Problems Encountered
Multiple route naming errors throughout the application:
1. `Route [pages.show] not defined` - should be `page.show`
2. `Route [contact] not defined` - should be `contact.index`
3. Array offset error with statistics data

## Root Causes
1. **Route Naming Inconsistency**: Routes were defined as singular (`page.show`, `contact.index`) but templates used plural or shortened versions
2. **Statistics Data Format**: HomeController returned wrong data structure for statistics

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed All Route Names
**Files Updated:**
- `heac-cms/resources/views/home.blade.php`
- `heac-cms/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- `pages.show` → `page.show` (all instances in navigation, footer, and content)
- `contact` → `contact.index` (all instances in navigation and CTAs)

### 2. Fixed Statistics Data Structure
**File:** `heac-cms/app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`

Changed from:
```php
return [
    'total_research' => Research::published()->count(),
    'total_downloads' => Research::published()->sum('downloads_count'),
    ...
];
```

To:
```php
return [
    ['value' => number_format(...), 'label' => 'Research Publications'],
    ['value' => number_format(...), 'label' => 'Total Downloads'],
    ...
];
```

### 3. Seeded Sample Content
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=SampleContentSeeder
```

### 4. Cleared All Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Current Status
✅ All tasks in the specification are now complete
✅ The homepage should now load without errors
✅ The "Learn More" button links to the About page correctly
✅ Sample content has been seeded into the database

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] "Learn More" button navigates to About page
- [ ] "Browse Research" button navigates to Research listing
- [ ] Admin panel is accessible at /admin
- [ ] Contact form works properly
- [ ] Research pages display correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test the homepage by visiting http://your-domain/
2. Verify all navigation links work
3. Test the admin panel at http://your-domain/admin
4. Upload actual research documents through the admin panel
5. Customize the homepage content through the CMS

## Notes
- The route naming convention in Laravel uses singular form: `page.show`, `research.show`, etc.
- All sample content can be edited or deleted through the admin panel
- Make sure to run migrations and seeders on production deployment
