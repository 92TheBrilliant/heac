# Contact Form Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Task 14: "Build contact form with spam protection" for the HEAC Laravel CMS.

## Implemented Features

### 14.1 Contact Form Validation Rules ✓
**File:** `app/Http/Requests/ContactFormRequest.php`

- Created a dedicated Form Request class for contact form validation
- **Validation Rules:**
  - `name`: Required, string, 2-255 characters
  - `email`: Required, valid email with RFC and DNS validation
  - `phone`: Optional, string, max 50 characters, regex pattern for phone numbers
  - `subject`: Optional, string, max 255 characters
  - `message`: Required, string, 10-5000 characters
- Custom error messages for better user experience
- Custom attribute names for cleaner error display

### 14.2 Honeypot Spam Protection ✓
**Files:** 
- `app/Http/Middleware/HoneypotProtection.php`
- `resources/views/contact.blade.php` (updated)

**Features:**
- Hidden honeypot field (`website`) that should remain empty
- Time-based submission check (minimum 3 seconds to fill form)
- Hidden `form_load_time` field to track submission speed
- Silently rejects spam with fake success message
- Logs spam attempts for monitoring

**How it works:**
1. Bots typically fill all fields including hidden ones
2. Bots submit forms faster than humans (< 3 seconds)
3. When spam is detected, user sees success message but inquiry is not saved
4. Legitimate users are unaffected

### 14.3 Email Notifications ✓
**Files:**
- `app/Mail/ContactInquiryNotification.php` - Admin notification
- `app/Mail/ContactInquiryAutoReply.php` - Auto-reply to submitter
- `resources/views/emails/contact/admin-notification.blade.php` - HTML template
- `resources/views/emails/contact/admin-notification-text.blade.php` - Plain text template
- `resources/views/emails/contact/auto-reply.blade.php` - HTML template
- `resources/views/emails/contact/auto-reply-text.blade.php` - Plain text template

**Admin Notification Email:**
- Sent to configured admin email address
- Contains all inquiry details (name, email, phone, subject, message)
- Includes metadata (submission time, IP address, inquiry ID)
- Reply-to header set to submitter's email
- Link to view inquiry in admin panel
- Professional HTML design with fallback plain text

**Auto-Reply Email:**
- Sent to the person who submitted the form
- Confirms receipt of their message
- Provides reference ID for tracking
- Includes contact information and office hours
- Links to FAQ and research sections
- Professional branded design

### 14.4 Rate Limiting ✓
**Files:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/ContactFormRateLimit.php`
- `bootstrap/app.php` (middleware registration)
- `routes/web.php` (middleware application)

**Features:**
- Limits submissions to 3 per hour per IP address
- User-friendly error message showing wait time
- Logs rate limit violations
- Only increments counter on successful submissions
- Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate users

## Middleware Architecture

The implementation uses a clean middleware approach:

```php
Route::post('/contact', [ContactController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware(['honeypot', 'contact.rate.limit'])
    ->name('contact.store');
```

**Middleware Chain:**
1. `honeypot` - Checks for spam indicators
2. `contact.rate.limit` - Enforces submission limits
3. Controller validates and processes the form

## Configuration

### Email Configuration
Add to `.env`:
```env
MAIL_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@heac.org
```

### Rate Limiting
Current settings (can be adjusted in `ContactFormRateLimit.php`):
- Max attempts: 3
- Decay time: 60 minutes

### Honeypot Settings
Current settings (can be adjusted in `HoneypotProtection.php`):
- Minimum form fill time: 3 seconds

## Security Features

1. **CSRF Protection** - Laravel's built-in CSRF tokens
2. **Honeypot** - Hidden field spam trap
3. **Time-based Check** - Detects bot submissions
4. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse
5. **Input Validation** - Strict validation rules
6. **Email Validation** - RFC and DNS validation
7. **Logging** - All spam attempts logged

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Submit valid form - should work normally
2. Fill honeypot field - should silently reject
3. Submit form quickly (< 3 seconds) - should silently reject
4. Submit 4 forms in an hour - 4th should show rate limit error
5. Check email delivery for both admin and auto-reply

### Automated Testing
Consider adding tests for:
- Form validation rules
- Honeypot detection
- Rate limiting behavior
- Email sending
- Spam logging

## Requirements Satisfied

✓ **Requirement 8.1** - Contact form with validation (name, email, phone, message)

## Next Steps

1. Configure email settings in `.env`
2. Test email delivery in staging environment
3. Monitor spam logs for effectiveness
4. Adjust rate limiting thresholds if needed
5. Consider adding CAPTCHA for additional protection if spam persists
